        <font color="black">I created this project in 22th September and this is my first application in Python/Django. For this job, I spent one day. For day I learned foundations to work in Django, learned pattern MVC and his "analog" MTV in philosophy Django. I remembered how to work with HTML and CSS.I also learned to use finished templates in my work. I also learned to use the templates for work, do the insertions of styles and scripts of JS. I figured out how to do the template inheritance and how to work with the static files.</font>
